  * WARNING: BREAKING CHANGE - The WithRedirect and RenderAsTTTemplate
    traits are now composed as default to reduce the amount of config
    needed in the tutorial, and as these are mostly what people want.
    If you don't want these traits, then you'll have to remove them with
    config.
  * Various documentation cleanups.
  * Remove dependency on Test::MockModule
  * Make OpenID support optional so that people don't get stuck installing
    Crypt::DH without the support modules which stop it taking forever.
